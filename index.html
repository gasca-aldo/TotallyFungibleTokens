        <h2>What is a Totally Fungible Token?</h2>
            <p>A TFT is a completely replaceable, not tradeable common file that has no more value or meaning than a regular JPG or MP3 file. Every TFT that you download (or screenshot) looks exactly the same than all the other copies!</p>
        <h2>Why should I pay for a TFT?</h2>
            <p>While with an old fashion NFT you have everyone speculating, TFT's are 100% clear with pricing. You get the JPG and since you can't sell it on a marketplace, the price will never drop! This is not a bubble that can pop at anytime. TFT's price doesn't change with timeWe don't use blockchain or any other technology so it's a lot more eco-friendly. </p>
        <h2>What stops me for screenshot it and not pay for a TFT?</h2>
            <p>Absolutetly nothing. I'm not going to tell you what to do. I'm not your mom, dude</p>
